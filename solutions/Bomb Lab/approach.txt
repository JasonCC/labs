In general see the functions : phase_1, phase_2 and so on.
Seeing the assembly instructions find out the program flow and then find our the phrases.

1. A string stored at an address. (Pretty Straight forward)
2. six numbers (loop)
3. Switch case (find out the correct combination from memory table)
4. Fibonnacci series. (Recursion)
5. It's jumbled string with redunancies which the code tries to match with "giants". Give the correct index numbers.
The fun part is, index numbers are 15 0 5 11 13 1. But these are not printable characters. In the code %al and 0xf are ANDed. So we can just take characters whose last 4 bits correspond to the numbers above. So multiple solutions are possible.
A few of them would be OPUKMA , OPekma, OPUKmA...
